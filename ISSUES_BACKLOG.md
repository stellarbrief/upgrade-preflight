# Issues backlog

Candidate issues, each written to be posted to GitHub as-is. Every entry states the current
state at a specific commit, what to build, how to verify it, and what is out of scope.
Complexity (Trivial / Medium / High) follows the tiers in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you pick one up, follow "Picking up an issue" in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Entries marked **Posted on GitHub** name the issue, and the GitHub issue is the source of truth for its status:
comment there, not here. This file keeps the original write-up and is not updated when an issue closes, and an
issue opened some other way may not be listed here at all. The rest are candidates that have not been posted yet.

### 1. Run a real two-protocol comparison in the CI integration job
**Complexity:** Medium
**Posted on GitHub:** #9

**Description**
The tool's central behavior (same scenarios on two protocol versions, then a diff) is only
exercised by hand. A regression in the two-network path would not fail CI.

**Current state**
`src/runner/run.integration.test.ts` boots one network at protocol 27 and diffs the result
against itself with `diffRun(27, 27, results, results, ...)`, which always returns `SAME`. The
two-network path in `src/cli/index.ts` runs only through the manual workflow
`.github/workflows/real-diff.yml`. That workflow found a real bug (per-network contract IDs made
every scenario look changed, fixed in `src/sdk/normalize.ts`) which no test had caught.

**What to build**
An integration test that calls `runAgainstProtocol` for protocol 27 and 28 on different host
ports and diffs them with `diffRun`. It should assert that every scenario has `status: 'ok'` on
both sides, that no scenario has verdict `ERROR`, and that the read-only scenarios have equal
events after normalization. State the CI time added (roughly four extra minutes) and decide
whether it runs on every push or on a schedule.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] The test fails if the identity normalization in `src/runner/run.ts` is removed.
- [ ] It skips cleanly, with a logged reason, when Docker is unavailable (same as the existing test).
- [ ] The PR states the CI time impact and the chosen trigger.

**Out of scope**
Asserting specific instruction counts. Changing the diff engine or thresholds.

**Verification**
`npm run test:integration` with Docker running.

---

### 2. Explain the instruction-count drop from protocol 27 to 28
**Complexity:** Medium (investigation)
**Posted on GitHub:** #17

**Description**
The first real 27 to 28 run showed instructions down 5.8% to 8.9% in every scenario. The
absolute drop is nearly constant (about 20k to 31k) even for very different scenarios, which
suggests a fixed per-call cost changed. That is a guess. Nobody has measured it.

**Current state**
The README's "A real captured result" section has the numbers (for example `sum-to-1000`:
342106 to 311611). `examples/contracts/heavy-loop` exposes `sum_to(n)`, so cost can be varied
with the amount of work.

**What to build**
Run `sum_to` with several values of n (for example 0, 1000, 10000, 100000) on protocols 27 and
28 using a scratch config, and separate the fixed cost from the per-iteration cost on each
protocol. Write the result to `docs/FINDINGS_27_TO_28.md` with the raw JSON reports linked or
committed. Trace the cause to a protocol change only if you can cite a source; otherwise say it
is unknown.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] A table of n against instructions for both protocols, from real runs.
- [ ] A clear statement of what the data does and does not establish.
- [ ] No change is attributed to a specific CAP without a link to its text.

**Out of scope**
Changing thresholds, the diff engine, or the example contracts.

**Verification**
After `npm run build`, reproduce any one row with
`node dist/cli/index.js run --from 27 --to 28 --config <your config>`.

---

### 3. Compare more than two protocol versions in one run
**Complexity:** High

**Description**
To see which protocol introduced a change you currently have to run several two-version
comparisons by hand.

**Current state**
`upgrade-preflight run --from X --to Y` (`src/cli/index.ts`) boots exactly two networks on host
ports 8000 and 8001, runs every scenario on both, and diffs once. The JSON report has
`schemaVersion: 1` and a single `fromProtocol`/`toProtocol` pair.

**What to build**
`--protocols 27,28,29` that runs each version once, sequentially, and diffs each adjacent pair,
producing one combined report that attributes each change to its version boundary.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] `--from`/`--to` keeps working unchanged.
- [ ] Each version's network is started once, not once per pair.
- [ ] The Markdown report labels each change by boundary (for example "27 to 28").
- [ ] The JSON report bumps `schemaVersion` and documents the new shape.
- [ ] Unit tests cover pair generation and verdict attribution without Docker.

**Out of scope**
Running networks in parallel. Diffing non-adjacent versions.

**Verification**
Unit tests (`npm test`), plus a real run: `node dist/cli/index.js run --protocols 27,28`.

---

### 4. Add a real-world contract corpus
**Complexity:** Medium
**Posted on GitHub:** #16

**Description**
The four example contracts are tiny, so the first real result says little about real contracts.

**Current state**
`examples/contracts/` has `hello-world`, `counter`, `heavy-loop` and `auth`, each with a
checked-in `.wasm` under `examples/wasm/` and a `CHECKSUMS.txt`.

**What to build**
Add two or three contracts taken from an open-source upstream Stellar repository (for example
one with token-style storage and events), pinned to a specific upstream commit and built with
the documented steps. Add a second config, `preflight.corpus.config.yml`, with scenarios that
cover a success path and one failure path per contract.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] The upstream repository, commit and license are recorded next to the sources.
- [ ] The wasm builds reproducibly and its checksum is added to `CHECKSUMS.txt`.
- [ ] The PR includes the Markdown report from a real 27 to 28 run of the new config.

**Out of scope**
Downloading wasm at run time. Changing the diff logic.

**Verification**
Follow `examples/README.md` to build, then `node dist/cli/index.js run --from 27 --to 28 --config preflight.corpus.config.yml`.

---

### 5. Verify the checked-in wasm checksums in CI
**Complexity:** Trivial
**Posted on GitHub:** #7

**Description**
A contract source change that forgets to rebuild its wasm would go unnoticed.

**Current state**
`examples/wasm/CHECKSUMS.txt` lists a SHA-256 per file in `sha256sum` format
(`<hash> *<file>`). Nothing in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` checks it.

**What to build**
A CI step in the `unit` job that runs `sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.txt` from `examples/wasm/` and
fails with a message naming the mismatched file.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] The step passes on `main` today.
- [ ] Altering one byte of a wasm makes the step fail and name that file.

**Out of scope**
Rebuilding the wasm in CI.

**Verification**
Run the same `sha256sum -c` command locally before and after altering a copy of a wasm file.

---

### 6. Add a per-scenario timeout
**Complexity:** Medium
**Posted on GitHub:** #10

**Description**
A hung RPC call stalls the whole run with no clear error.

**Current state**
`runScenario` in `src/runner/run.ts` has no explicit timeout around building, simulating or
submitting a scenario. Only network startup is bounded (`waitHealthy`, 120 seconds).

**What to build**
An optional `timeoutMs` (per scenario, with a global default in the config schema) that turns a
timed-out scenario into a result with `status: 'error'` and a clear message, which the diff
engine already reports as `ERROR`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] A scenario that exceeds its timeout reports `ERROR` and the run continues.
- [ ] The config schema documents the new field and its default.
- [ ] A unit test uses an injected slow function and a fake clock.

**Out of scope**
Retrying a timed-out scenario.

**Verification**
`npm test`.

---

### 7. Post the report as a pull request comment from the GitHub Action
**Complexity:** High

**Description**
The report is only visible in the job summary, which reviewers rarely open.

**Current state**
`action/action.yml` builds the CLI, runs it, and appends the Markdown to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
`docs/CI_USAGE.md` documents the inputs and exit codes.

**What to build**
An opt-in `comment-on-pr` input that posts the report as a PR comment using the run's own
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and updates that same comment on re-runs instead of adding new ones.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Re-running the workflow edits the existing comment.
- [ ] It does nothing on non-PR events and when the token cannot write (for example fork PRs).
- [ ] `docs/CI_USAGE.md` documents the input and the permissions it needs.

**Out of scope**
Other CI providers. Failing the build based on the comment.

**Verification**
Run the action from a test repository's pull request and link the resulting comment in your PR.

---

### 8. Import a scenario from a transaction hash
**Complexity:** High

**Description**
Scenarios are hand-written YAML. A developer who saw a transaction fail has to translate it by
hand.

**Current state**
`src/config/schema.ts` defines the scenario shape (contract, function, typed args). Argument
encoding is in `src/sdk/args.ts`. There is no import path.

**What to build**
`upgrade-preflight import-tx --hash <hash> --rpc <url>` that fetches the transaction, decodes
its contract invocation (contract, function, arguments), and prints a scenario in the existing
YAML shape. Argument types the schema cannot express should produce a clear error, not a wrong
scenario.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Works against a captured Testnet transaction fixture in unit tests, without network access.
- [ ] A clear error when the invocation uses an unsupported argument type.
- [ ] A clear message that the contract's wasm must be supplied separately.

**Out of scope**
Deploying the contract automatically. Mainnet credentials.

**Verification**
Unit tests with the fixture, plus a manual run against a public Testnet RPC.

---

### 9. Cover argument-encoding edge cases in tests
**Complexity:** Trivial
**Posted on GitHub:** #8

**Description**
Bad arguments should fail with a clear message, and every supported type should be tested.

**Current state**
`src/sdk/args.test.ts` covers five cases: `u32`, an `i128` given as a string, `symbol`, the
`source-account` sentinel, and `bytes` as hex. The schema also supports `i32`, `u64`, `i64`,
`u128`, `bool`, `string` and `address`, which have no tests.

**What to build**
Tests for each untested type, including a non-ASCII `string`, `u64`/`i64`/`u128` boundary values,
a negative value for an unsigned type, and an invalid `address`. Fix `toScVal` only if a test
exposes a real bug.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Every type in `ScVarArgSchema` has at least one passing test.
- [ ] Invalid input is asserted to throw with a readable message.

**Out of scope**
Adding new argument types.

**Verification**
`npm test`.
